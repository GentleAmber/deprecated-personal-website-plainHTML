          I enjoy good games. Curiousity of games is a major inspiration for me to learn programming. My personal top 3 are: 
          <br /><br />
          <span class="text-highlight">- Disco Elysium</span><br />
          <span class="text-highlight">- Outer Wilds</span><br />
          <span class="text-highlight">- Divinity: Original Sin 2</span><br />
          <br />
          Basically, I love games either with good narratives or with good gameplay where I can learn, explore or mess around. 
          DE is the representative of good narrative, 
          DOS2 has good gameplay, and OW has a perfect mix of the two aspects.

        <p>
          I used to work out a lot and can still do a few push-ups at once. 
          Earlier this year I did <span class="text-highlight">bouldering</span> 
          once a week. It was really fun and provided a huge sense of accomplishment. 
          However, after I got injured and developed neck and shoulders
           pain from it, I switched to doing <span class="text-highlight">Pilates</span>
            later on. So far the pain has
            been gone, and I am eager to explore other interesting exercises.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/interest-turing1.png" height="380" alt="Screenshot of a cpu built in the game Turing Complete">
        <p>
          I felt I needed to understand more about <span class="text-highlight">how computer works</span> on my journey of learning programming.
           So I did a bit of Nand2Tetris course and played Turing Complete to help myself understand. 
           I have learnt how single electronic components form into complex ones, 
           what machine codes are, and how to programme with assembly language to achieve 
           minor functions. It was a wonderful journey and I plan to keep learning about computers and programming in the future.

          I like learning <span class="text-highlight">English</span> as well. 
          Because my mother is a dedicated English teacher, 
          I started learning English at an early age, and it became a familiar language to me. 
          Having said that, there is still a great number of vocabularies and phrases 
          I have not known yet, and I enjoy discovering them.
